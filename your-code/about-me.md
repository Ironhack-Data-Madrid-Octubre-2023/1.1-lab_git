My name is Miguel Cuadros, I am from Madrid and currently I am doing a data analysis bootcamp. I did not know a thing a bout computer languages or anything related to oit but I always liked playing around with code and stuff like that. I am here because I want to find a better future with more opportunities because I come from an AV background which isnot really safe (if we focus on job stability). A friend of mine did the same bootcamp coming from the same bg as me and it went pretty well for him so I am looking to follow his steps. I want to take the most out of this experience and learn as much as I can to nail a good job soon. My goal is to become a digital nomad, I am used to travel around the world because of my previous job and I would like to be able to work anywhere I want to go
