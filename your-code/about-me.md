# About me

## General info
My name is Javi, although I prefer people call me Koh. I'm 26 and I like the colour black and magenta.

## Background
I studied English Literature and Linguistics and Universidad Complutense de Madrid and have been working as an English teacher since my second year of college.

Surprisingly enough, being a major in literature doesn't give you money if you don't want to go through the academic route; people doesn't pay me when I explain to them Hamlet's plot.

Now, I've been self-learning how to code since May and have only stopped on August after completing Madrid 42's Piscine.

## Food
My favourite food are croquetas and sopita de ajo ah√≠ bien rica.
